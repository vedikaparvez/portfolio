    title: "Steve Jobs",
    author: "Walter Isaacson",
    genre: "Biography",
    review: `Definitely classifies as your quintessential 'keeps-you-hooked' kind of biography. The book takes many winding emotional turns, as did Jobs's life. 
      I'd like to believe Jobs truly had no say in his depiction in his biography but the recurrent portrayal of him needing to be in control of everything in his life at all times  doesn't quite drive confidence in the fact.
      Definitely a good read for founders seeking insight into the entrepreneurial world or just fellow humans seeking inspiration.`,

    title: "Shoe Dog",
    author: "Phil Knight",
    genre: "Biography",
    review: `What. A. Book.
    It's by far my favorite read in the world of biographies.
    My biggest takeaway from Shoe Dog was that you don't have to be an extrovert, or have marshall leadership skills to become an entrepreneur. 
    Trust in your idea, expertise in the domain and most importantly - good intent - is enough and more!This has definitely gone down as a 'book that can change your life' for me.`,

    title: "Sprint: How to Solve Big Problems and Test New Ideas in Just Five Days",
    author: "Jake Knapp",
    genre: "Self-Help",
    review: `Sprint is a very practical, hands-on, and well structured book. Its take on how to test new ideas in just five days is the essence of multiple trials and errors with many companies over many years.Its strong underpinning makes it a great read for entrepreneurs, product managers, designers, in fact any team member working to test a new idea or solve an existing problem.Tone of writing is fairly neutral, making this book more of an informational/learning read that one may not be able to opine much on.`,

    title: "The Subtle Art Of Not Giving a Fuck",
    author: "Mark Manson",
    genre: "Self-Help",
    review: `I read this iconic self help book that probably made more headlines than any other book on the internet a couple years after its release. Ergo, I'd pinned a lot of hope on this one.
    Albeit it lived up to 80% of its hype with its sound logical opinions backed by relevant anecdotes. Mark encourages the reader to embrace conflict, to be comfortable feeling uncomfortable, and to be confident in finding out what you truly believe in.
    Good read! It can get draggy at times though.`,

    title: "Elon Musk",
    author: "Ashlee Vance",
    genre: "Biography",
    review: `Vance doesn't make Musk a God like the media, or even Musk popularly does.
    His approach to Musk's biography feels raw, honest and one that will break down for you this towering corporate deity to that of a common man who's reached heights of success mostly owing to his hard work and dedication.The section where Vance details how if an engineer was fired by Musk due to poor performance, Musk himself would fill in his shoes and take the project to completion personally had a lot to take away from and was very inspiring to say the least.`,

    title: "The 5 AM Club",
    author: "Robin Sharma",
    genre: "Self-help",
    review: `Personal opinion but if you asked me whether you should read 'The 5 AM Club' in person I'd probably say “naaah, not really”.
    No shade on the book, it's well structured and inspriring to an extent. However, its preachy tone of writing made me feel like Sharma was being sententious to a fault.
    Overall its an okay-okay read. Some parts might serve as motivational content and a partial mood lifter.`,
