        üëãüèª Hey there! I'm Vedika, your go-to gal for all things B2B SaaS product
        management, with a background in linguistic AI research. Over the
        last 6 years, I've journeyed through the tech world, leading the charge
        from ideation to execution, it's been quite the ride!
      </p>
      <p className="mb-3">
        üî• What drives me? It's the thrill in mastering 'systems thinking'
        allowing me to approach product management with a holistic vision, the
        joy of seeing a product come to life, and the satisfaction of knowing it
        makes a difference. Looking ahead, I'm all in on pushing the boundaries
        of what's possible, exploring new markets, and maybe, just maybe,
        revolutionizing a few more industries along the way.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-3">
        üí¨ Wanna chat about the future of tech, swap product stories, or discuss
        the latest in AI? Hit me up. Let's make something awesome together!
