    title: "Playing golf",
    body: `
    I held a golf club for the first time at the age of 6, and there was no looking back!
    
    As an adolescent the fresh air, lush greens and open space brought me back to the course on the regular. I trained and played the South Zone Amateur circuit in India for 3 consecutive years. 
    
    I still thoroughly enjoy playing the closest sport I've found to life, and make it a point to play as many courses across the globe as I can. So far the record's been Ugolino in Spain, Andermatt in Switzerland, etc.`,

    I read somewhere that “Music heals the soul, it calms us, centres us, and creates focus in our lives. Written so far ahead of its time, classical music reminds us of an important message: that humanity struggles onwards despite the odds.”, and I couldn't agree more.
    
    Growing up playing Bach, Mozart, Telemann, and Vivaldi's compositions, music from the Baroque period always heightens my emotions to a great degree. My two decade connection with music has been one of my biggest pillars of strength so far.
    
    My favourite composition from the era hands down is Mozart's Eine kleine Nachtmusik!

    Hiking + Traveling = I LIKE! 

    Apart from the peripatetic lifestyle I try to maintain on the daily, I'm nearly always surfing the net to find hyperlocal, local and national hiking spots to climb next.

    The genesis of my love for trekking began after my first trek - conquering the summit at the Roopkund trek in the Garhwal range of the great Himalayas. Ever since, the itch to go on short and easy or long challenging hikes hasn't left me.

    I periodically go on hyperlocal day treks during the year in the Southern region of India, and plan annual treks in other places.

    This apart leisurely vacations confidently find place in my yearly calendar! As of May 2022, I've traveled to 8 countries world over.`,
